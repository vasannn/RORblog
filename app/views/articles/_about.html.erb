    Introduction:<br>
    Greetings! I'm Vasan, a final-year B.Tech IT student at SSN College of Engineering and currently contributing to projects at Finsire.<br>
    I am deeply interested in full-stack development and actively exploring the field. In my projects, I aim to build robust and engaging platforms, leveraging modern frameworks and tools for both front-end and back-end development. My focus is on learning and mastering technologies that enable seamless and secure user experiences.<br>
